"ironic, Great benefits, nice people in the company, M-F and sweet holiday pay, As a company who values mental health, they did nothing to help one of their employees who was struggling. When someone says ""this role is making my mental health drop"", the company's response should not be ""well you need to get your numbers up before we can recommend you to another position"". The management in customer service needs improvement and empathy. Also, in the time we are living, online jobs can be done at home and you shouldn't force your employees to go back to the office if it doesn't work for them."
"Most disorganized company; misleading and toxic work culture, Good starting salary, decent benefits, Claims to be a diverse, inclusive and supportive culture -- to the point of pushing employees to vote for awards so they can claim such titles –– while consistently pushing the complaints of marginalized workers under the rug. Extremely disorganized and those who work the hardest are rewarded the least. No room for growth at this point in time, seems that wasn't always the case. The most disorganized and misleading place I've ever worked."
", Good work life balance. Amazing people., Life has become difficult lately."
"It's ok, Pay is above what you normally would get as a customer support rep., Angry callers pizza party's instead of pay raises"
"Average job, Benefits, coworkers are friendly, inclusive culture, Work is tiring, typical customer service job. You get yelled at almost all day everyday."
"Run., The paying off school loans thing is cool., Your job security is NEVER promised. The do secret mass lay offs almost every year. It happened twice in the few short years I was there. I was in one of them. They really do not care as long as their company stays in the green. They pay us in gift cards for positive reviews. Work here for a bit but always stay applying to places. They don’t care I promise you. Also no room for growth. Have 0 expectations on that. Negotiation for a salary you’re comfortable with because you won’t see a raise unless you switch roles which is practically impossible."
"Very good culture, Amazing culture Job security Average benefits Low work pressure Flexible timings, Very less growth opportunities Low appraisal"
