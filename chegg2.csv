"This company is very good for students and anyone who needs a part time job. although anyone can work as full time, No pressure, can work from any time, any where. salary is on time., Questions are not available all time. Some time the question volume of whole month is very low., This company is a very good option for freelancing. Any student can work here and become financially independent. No work pressure is here. you can earn from anywhere and any time. But questions are not available all time. If you want to solve question, then you have to attend it when question volume is high."
"Run., Work from home, Not real job security, You’ll work here and they’ll make it seem progressive and they care. But in reality they lay off hundreds of people secretly every couple of years. It happened 3x when I was there. The reason you don’t hear about it is because they tell people they won’t give you severance unless you remain silent. The good thing is now there’s a law preventing them from doing this. You can work here if you like flexibility and work from home, but I would always be applying to places while you’re there. Especially if you’re in sales, marketing, and or any lower level totem pole."
"Great place to work for salaried employees, , , I did really enjoy my time at chegg and I loved my coworkers. I do feel like the customer service team is the forgotten step child of chegg. We deal with the hardest customers and sometimes it can be difficult. And upward mobility is hard. Benefits are solid however."
"Unproductive and on the verge of harassment in some divisions of the company, the company Benefits that are given to the employees. It's the only way they keep employees because they are full of arrogant and immature managers., The constant knee jerk reaction changes made with no forethought or planning prior to making them; Backstabbing and lying to employees,"
"Productive and fun, Nice, zero burden, None, Nice, learnt a lot about the core and its all about the subject knowledge. The more you are familiar with the subject the more you will earn. Its great for freelancers."
"Completel lack of support from management, , , Chegg could be a great place to work but there is a complete lack of support from management. I felt discriminated against in my role and was expected to work miracles with only 30 minutes of time with supervisor per week. Lots of instances where expectation of work was set and then a complete 180 of expectations with unreasonable turnaround time. They do pay a good wage, but it is not worth the trauma they will put you through. No work/life balance."
"Bad question flow, , , Not recommended for working in today's scenerio. If the questions flow were good the payout per question is highest there is. At most the question per month i got is 30-40. Even if you apply for normal subject, they give advanced question so you will end up skipping a lot. Also new policy doesn't pay if the answer is below rating. The spoiled brats give low rating for no reason sometimes."
"It was completely flexible. Work when you felt like it, , , At finals times the rates would go to as high as $40 an hour. However, that stopped towards the end. Either way, I was overqualified, underpaid, and unimpressed."
"Terrible company that got rid of tutoring service, , , Chegg does not treat the employees with ethics and got rid of the tutoring service and let everyone go. DO NOT WORK HERE. UNETHICAL! They don't have enough work as well."
"Freedom, Good pay, lots of freedom, only ten courses allowed to develop which limits possibility of further growth and job security"
"Self learning is the best part of the firm with flexible work hours, It's a great place to work. With no overloading of work. Management is answerable to employees. Perks and benefits are insane. Good work culture. Work from home is available"
